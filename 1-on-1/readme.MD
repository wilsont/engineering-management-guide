## General Notes

- Your are the owner of the 1:1, not your manager
- I will create a google doc and share between us and we keep our conversation private
- I prefer you to share the screen and open the 1:1 doc to drive the discussion
- Feel free to pre-fill the topics you would love to discussion before the 1:1 on the document
- 50% of time spend on status report / tech discussion, while another 50% of time should spend on discussing personal growth like topics you love/hate, your status quo, any non-tech problems that you are facing.
- Be transparent, I don't have a crystal ball so please bring up the topics so I can offer my help / opinion. Please don't expect me to know all the details of your daily routine
- My mission is to help you to success in your role
- Feel free to bring up any topic even though you know that I don't have a solution
