## How to manage an engineering team

- Service
    - Golden Signals
    - Business KPIs of your service (E.g. # of orders if that is a checkout service, # of logins if this is an Oauth2 service)
    - No. of incident
    - SLAs/SLOs
    - No. of bugs
    - Cloud Costs per week/month
    - Unit/Integration test coverage
    - Code Quality (e.g. codacy/linting)
    - Load Testing

- Team
    - Deployment Frequency 
    - PR cycling Time
    - JIRA ticket cycling Time / Workflow Bottleneck (which steps took the most time? CR? Deployment? etc)
    - Run a team health check exercise every 1-2 quarter
    - NPS score from the survey (e.g. peakon)
    - turn-over rate
    - How many 1:1s you've skipped
    - % of completion on quarterly roadmap
